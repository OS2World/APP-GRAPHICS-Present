Present!	(NC)Not Copyrighted by the Frobozz Magic Software Company

About the program:
------------------

Present! is a PM application that allows the user to make simple slide shows
and display these on the PM desktop.
The current version is a simple port from my OS/2 1.3 version that I wrote
two years ago.

Presentation scripts:
---------------------

Presentations are created using scripts. These script are plain ascii files
with keywords. A simple example presentation is included with most of the
allowed words in it. The keywords and their meaning are:

title	- sets the title of the presentation (in the window header)
size	- sets the size of the the window in pixels
page	- specifies a bitmap to load as background for the presentation

sheet	- start a sheet. Needs a sheet number
mode	- sheet mode: T for title sheet, B for bullet sheet
		(sorry, no others)
next	- indicates the number of the next sheet

line	- Line of text in a sheet
align	- alignment of current line, C for centered, L for left, R right
font	- font family for current line
point	- point size for font
type	- typeface: I - italic, B - bold, U - underline, S - strikeout
		(may be combined)
colour	- line colour: white, black, blue, red, pink, green, cyan, yellow,
		darkgray, darkblue, darkred, darkpink, darkgreen, darkcyan,
		brown, palegray
fx	- effects to use on line: S - shadow, D - depth

Known bugs:
-----------

Present! does not correctly handle loading and running a second presentation
without leaving the application.
